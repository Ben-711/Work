# Work
What do I do?  What do you do?  What is work?

As a 10+ year veteran in Labor and Employee Relations and Human Resources, I am often called upon to advise supervisors on the best approach to managing their employees.  I provide counsel on legal constraints governing changes to the terms and conditions of other people's work and am responsible for "prosecuting" violations of workplace policies.  I also provide guidance on motivating employees and creating a positive work culture.  

I have worked with blue-collar workers, white-collar workers, healthcare providers, police officers, IT personnel, and university professors.  I have worked with skilled and unskilled laborers, knowledge workers, service workers, and volunteers.  I have experience with public-sector and private-sector employees and with union-represented and non-union employees.  In some ways, my work is everybody's work, and in some ways, it is very much different.

I am fascinated by the idea of work.  What is it?  Why do we do it?  What motivates us? 

Labor histories provide an informative perspective.  In the mid-late 19th century the US was in the midst of the second industrial revolution.  Work was hard and often dangerous.  There was a huge demand for the production of coal, iron, and steel - the commodities necessary to build the expanding railroad industry.  Employer corporations seeking to maximize shareholder profits did so at the expense of their employees.  This resulted in a prolonged period of extensive and often violent conflict.

Starting around the 1870's, Employees began to understand the power they could wield by collectively withholding their labor.  This was particularly true of skilled workmen who often organized by trade.  Others in the labor movement attempted to organize workers more inclusively and represent all the employees engaged in a specific industry.  Some even supported the idea of organizing all of labor into "one big union."

Within the labor movement, there were many ideological differences ranged from conservative views such as collectivism, mutualism and voluntarism to more radical viewpoints such as communism, anarchism, syndicalism.  There were successes and failures and always further iteration and refinement.  The ideas of the labor movement have always been diverse and they still are today.  Some believe labor disputes should be resolved through direct action, others favor collective bargaining and still others favor petitioning the government for legislative and regulatory solutions.  

Most business leaders will tell you that they value their employees and want to create a positive culture and work environment.  Indeed, employee engagement is one of the most predictive factors of success in todayâ€™s professional world. Engaged employees are passionate about their jobs, loyal to their employer, and put discretionary effort into their work.  Understanding the evolution of work, workplace conflict and human motiviation is vital in creating a positive culture where employees will thrive.
